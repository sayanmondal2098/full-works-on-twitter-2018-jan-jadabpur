Hi!
I created the file for Sillycon .


BagofWords.py  -> 

ScrapperAndAnalysis.py -> It'll download datas from twitter and analysis the Positivity and negativity using AILEN Api client 

naturalprocessingwordnet.py -> get getsynonyms,getsynonyms, tokenize_sentences etc 

In nltk-based-word-checking folder -
            /naturalprocessingwordnet -> dictionary checking and check from bag of words and sort it .
            sentencecounter.py      -> return different parameters from sentence
